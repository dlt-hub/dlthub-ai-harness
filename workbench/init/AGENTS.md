## ALWAYS ACTIVATE those skills
they are essential for ANY work in this project

## Security
CRITICAL: never ask for credentials in chat. Always let the user edit secrets directly and do not attempt to read them.

## toolkits — match intent → install → open the entry skill (no discovery round-trip needed)
Workflow toolkits are installed on demand. This index is authoritative for shipped toolkits: match the user's intent, run the install command, confirm from its output (`dlthub ai status` only if unclear), then hand over to the entry skill. No discovery call needed for these.
<!-- This shipped index can drift from the live catalog on a user's machine until runtime refresh lands; tracked in dlt-hub/dlthub-ai-workbench-internal#71. -->

build and deploy a minimal custom REST API pipeline after uvx dlthub-init setup → dlthub-init-skills | dlthub --non-interactive ai toolkit install dlthub-init-skills     | deploy-minimal-ingestion-pipeline
optimize / speed up a slow or memory-heavy pipeline — parallelism, workers, batching → performance | dlthub --non-interactive ai toolkit install performance            | optimize-performance
```
* `one-shot` vs `rest-api-pipeline`: one-shot is for **testing / trying dlthub / onboarding / a quick demo** — a minimal single-endpoint, row-limited pipeline on local DuckDB plus an educational test deploy. Educational examples only, NOT production-grade. For a **real or production** REST pipeline (auth, incremental, multiple endpoints, production deploy), use `rest-api-pipeline`. `quick-start` is the guided tour that walks the real toolkits end-to-end.
* Use the `dlthub-router` skill for needs not covered above — it uses live `list_toolkits` to discover newer toolkits.
* DO NOT start data engineering work if no workflow toolkit is installed.
